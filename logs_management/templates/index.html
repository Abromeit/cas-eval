      <h2>How to</h2>
      <p>Setting up is easy and requires only a few minutes.
      After that you will be helping us by just doing searches and occasionally giving quick
      feedback.</p>
      <p>You can easily opt out from the experiment at any time. Or you can switch from our logging proxy to a normal search engine back and forth without much effort.</p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
          We collect your data to do research.
          Ultimately, we want to build a model of user behavior on a Search Engine Result Page
          and propose a new evaluation metric.
      </p>
      <p>
          Your data is stored and accessed securely and your privacy is protected.
          Only you have access to your log.
          You can delete the queries that you consider privacy-sensitive at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
          Note that we will be able to use your data <b>only after</b> you explicitly transfer
          it to us. At this point your search log will be anonymized and shuffled so that
          there will be no way to identify you.
