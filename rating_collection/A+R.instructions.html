<h2>1. Attractiveness of the Document Summary</h2>

<p>In this task you are given a question and a document summary.
You will be asked to judge if examining the full document
(from which the summary was extracted) is useful for answering the question. </p>

<h3>Task (Attractiveness):</h3>
<blockquote style="font-size: medium; color: #4C4C4E;">
    <strong>Do you think examining the full document will be useful to answer the question?</strong>
</blockquote>
<span class="hint">
    HINT: Do not try to follow any links while answering this question, but think if following the link would be worthy.
</span>

<h3>Possible Answers (Attractiveness):</h3>

<ul>
    <li><span class="answer">Likely, yes</span> should be chosen when the summary makes you believe the document is worth examining.</li>

    <li><span class="answer">Likely, no</span> should be chosen when the summary makes you believe the document is not interesting.</li>

    <li><span class="answer">Question/summary is not in English</span> should be chosen only if you are sure that the question and/or summary is in language that you don't understand. Keep in mind that it may be just a technical term in English, so do not select this answer unless you are absolutely sure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Full Document Relevance</h2>

<p>Once you are done with the Attractiveness task, you may proceed to the next one.
In this task, you will be given a question and a web document to judge.
You will be asked to judge if the document contains an answer to the question or not.
Your rating should be made based on our rules only; this task is not asking for opinion.</p>

<h3>Task (Relevance)</h3>
<blockquote style="font-size: medium; color: #4C4C4E;">
    <strong>Does the document contain an answer to the question?</strong>
</blockquote>
<span class="hint">
    HINT: If you are familiar with document relevance tasks, this is one is very similar.
</span>

<h3>Possible Answers (Relevance):</h3>

<ul>
    <li><span class="answer">Perfect match</span> is for documents that match the question perfectly. E.g., the <i>Wikipedia page</i> for the question <span class="query">[genome]</span> or the <i>Facebook homepage</i> for the question <span class="query">[facebook]</span>.</li>

    <li><span class="answer">Relevant document with possible differences</span> when the document matches the question in general but there is ambiguity that does not allow to choose "Perfect match" with certainty. Also choose this variant if there are multiple interpretation of the question and the document matches to only one of them (for example, the question <span class="query">[jaguar speed]</span> may refer to the car or the animal).</li>

    <li><span class="answer">Marginally relevant: obvious differences</span> should be chosen when there is a logical connection between the question and the document, but there is also an obvious mismatch. For example, the question <span class="query">[GDP of Switzerland]</span> is related to the page talking about <i>languages of Switzerland</i>, but those are different things.</li>

    <li><span class="answer">Irrelevant / Offtopic</span> is for cases when the question and the document are talking about different things, even though there might be some common words. E.g., a <i>recipe of Peking duck</i> is irrelevant for the question <span class="query">[peking university]</span>.</li>

  <li><span class="answer">Cannot open the document</span> should only be chosen if you cannot open the document or get an error.</li>

  <li><span class="answer">The document is not in English</span> should be chosen only if you are sure that the document is in language you don't understand. Keep in mind that it may be a technical term in English, so do not select this answer unless you are absolutely sure.</li>
</ul>
