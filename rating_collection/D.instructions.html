<div class="instructions">
    <u><b>IMPORTANT</b></u>: <span class="important">Answer is not the same as matching words</span>. For instance, for the question <span class="query">[normal body temperature]</span> an answer is needed, not just some random text where words "normal", "body" and "temperature" occur.
    <br/>
    <u><b>IMPORTANT</b></u>: Prefer <span class="answer">partial answer</span> to <span class="answer">full answer</span> if in doubt!
